Description: Implements readers and writers for file formats associated with genetics data.  Reading and writing Plink BED/BIM/FAM and GCTA binary GRM formats is fully supported, including a lightning-fast BED reader and writer implementations.  Other functions are 'readr' wrappers that are more constrained, user-friendly, and efficient for these particular applications; handles Plink and Eigenstrat tables (FAM, BIM, IND, and SNP files).  There are also make functions for FAM and BIM tables with default values to go with simulated genotype data.
